Gamedu is a project about games in Education

I participated in the integration between the developed games with the web
platform. For copyrights issues I cannot post the code in my public repository.

To access the functionalities of the platform, it is necessary to login, which
is restricted to the group while it is still in development:
http://gamedu.net

I implemented the registration area of the site for the game competition, but
they are now in the fase of capacitation.
