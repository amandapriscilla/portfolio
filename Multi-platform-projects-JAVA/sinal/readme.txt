The SINAL was a project for a course where a php script run in a mobile device
that was supposed to be used by the bus driver, sending the position of the bus in 
real time to the server in Java that updates the information on a web page.

It was just a prototype for a course, hosted in private server for the 
course presentation. It was used as example for many professors, and the idea now is being applied by research projects in the city.

Credits for the layout and logo to our web designer Ystallonne Carlos.

My role was to assign tasks using an academic portal called Redmine, develop the architecture document and implementation, and important user cases, such as the estimation of arrival time based on location of the bus and registration of drivers.
I also was responsible to transform the design work from Ystallonne from images into HTML and CSS for the layout.

An important achievement in this project was that we had technical issues with the tool we were using to storage and host the project on the cloud, which made us loose part of the source code. Since, we were students and my friends had other courses as priorities, I took the lead to recover the project. I had to redo many fixings that were already implemented before (even by other members of the team) in less than 2 days, to have a working and nice version of the system, which received a good evaluation from professors.
