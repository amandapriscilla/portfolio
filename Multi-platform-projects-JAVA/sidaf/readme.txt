The SIDAF was a system that I built with a group of 6 developers in 
Brazil, and we had a real client which was a drugstore network of the government,
for that reason, the code cannot be publicly available, but all the documentation is here.

It was divided into 3 modules: mobile and desktop using .NET technologies and web in Java (JSP and Hibernate) to fulfill course requirements, and my role in the group
was to develop the web module, some entity models and core controllers. As well as collaborated with the group to design the integration and the database.
